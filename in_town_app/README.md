Most of the time, out-of-towners have no idea what they want to do while visiting New York City. inTown is here to solve just that. inTown is a web app used for New Yorkers who will be having visitors and need to plan out the trip with places to see and things todo. 

The New Yorker will over the link to the visitor. They then select the attractions they want to do. Then they email the list to the New Yorker. (In the future, the email will lead to the route to take the visitor. It will have routes that navigate the city geographically, to optimize time and see the most things as possible. Example: Visit Wall Street, Raging Bull, and the Fearless Girls all at once instead of jumping from Central Park, to 9/11 Memorial to SoHo.)
